#' Connection Weights
#'
#' @description
#' This class implements the \emph{Connection Weights} method investigated by
#' Olden et al. (2004), which results in a relevance score for each input
#' variable. The basic idea is to multiply all path weights for each
#' possible connection between an input feature and the output node and then
#' calculate the sum over them. Besides, it is originally a global
#' interpretation method and independent of the input data. For a neural
#' network with \eqn{3} hidden layers with weight matrices \eqn{W_1},
#' \eqn{W_2} and \eqn{W_3}, this method results in a simple matrix
#' multiplication independent of the activation functions in between:
#' \deqn{W_1 * W_2 * W_3.}
#'
#' In this package, we extended this method to a local method inspired by the
#' method *Gradient x Input* (see [Gradient]). Hence, the local variant is
#' simply the pointwise product of the global *Connection Weights* method and
#' the input data. You can use this variant by setting the `times_input`
#' argument to `TRUE` and providing input data.

    #' Create a new instance of the *Connection Weights* method. When
    #' initialized, the method is applied to the given data and the results
    #' are stored in the field `result`.
    #'
    #' @param output_idx These indices specify the output nodes for which
    #' the method is to be applied. In order to allow models with multiple
    #' output layers, there are the following possibilities to select
    #' the indices of the output nodes in the individual output layers:
    #' \itemize{
    #'   \item A `vector` of indices: If the model has only one output layer,
    #'   the values correspond to the indices of the output nodes, e.g.
    #'   `c(1,3,4)` for the first, third and fourth output node. If there are
    #'   multiple output layers, the indices of the output nodes from the first
    #'   output layer are considered.
    #'   \item A `list` of `vectors` of indices: If the method is to be
    #'   applied to output nodes from different layers, a list can be passed
    #'   that specifies the desired indices of the output nodes for each
    #'   output layer. Unwanted output layers have the entry `NULL` instead of
    #'   a vector of indices, e.g. `list(NULL, c(1,3))` for the first and
    #'   third output node in the second output layer.
    #'   \item `NULL` (default): The method is applied to all output nodes in
    #'   the first output layer but is limited to the first ten as the
    #'   calculations become more computationally expensive for more output
    #'   nodes.
    #' }
    #' @param times_input Multiplies the results with the input features.
    #' This variant tuns the global *Connection Weights* method into a local
    #' one. Default: `FALSE`.
